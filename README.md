The algorithm is DP
step 1: get the longest common strand in each pair of 10 files. Other common strand must be shorter or equal to it. So this strand is the global longest common strand
step 2: check wheter other contains this longest common strand, if yes, store the filename and offset in result map
step 3: output the files that contains longest common strand and the offset in each file
